This repository contains the (anonymized) data collected for the study detailed in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24175

- funny_numbers_survey.pdf is a PDF version of the Google Forms survey given to participants.

- survey_responses.xlsx contains all of the responses received to the survey (with personal information redacted), including responses that were removed for being trivial cases (columns labelled "non-mimetic"). Zero Context data is in the sheet labelled "Part 1" and Minimal Context data is in the sheet labelled "Part 2." These sheets are saved individually as survey_responses_part1.csv and survey_responses_part2.csv, which are read in by funny_numbers_analysis.ipynb.

- funny_numbers_analysis.ipynb is a slightly cleaned up and marginally commented version of the code used for data analysis and to make the figures in the paper. Everything runs as of March 30, 2025.
